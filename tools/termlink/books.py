"""Which files a book is made of, and in which order.

The order matters: a term is never linked in a chapter that comes *before* the
chapter defining it. Within one year the two-digit filename prefix would do, but
a book spans several years (Book 1 has nine), and grade-3/01 and grade-9/01 are
both "chapter 01". So the sequence is read from the book's own entry file, which
is the same order the reader meets the chapters in.
