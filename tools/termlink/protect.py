"""Spans of a source file that must never be touched.

Everything a link would break: math, comments, macro arguments, environment
names and their key arguments (wrapping a term inside \\begin{solution}{exo:...}
once blew up the build).

Deliberately NOT protected, because links are wanted there: tabular bodies (a
grade book puts real prose in its cells, and Book 5 links two terms inside a
table row), omfigure captions (Book 5 has 27 links in captions), and method
bodies (imperative prose -- exactly where a young reader needs the link).

Writing a pattern (here or in a book's EXTRA_PROTECT): NEVER CONSUME A `$`.
The whole list is one alternation scanned left to right, so a pattern that eats
an opening $ leaves the inline-math rule pairing the *closing* $ with the next
formula's opening one -- and from there every span is masked inside out for the
rest of the file. It reports no error; the link count just quietly collapses
(one such pattern cost Book 3 a thousand links before it was noticed). Match a
trailing $ with a lookahead, never with a literal.
