"""Which terms are linkable, and to which definition.

Sources, in order of trust:

  * \\emph{term}\\index{...} inside a `definition` -- the convention in
    CONTRIBUTING.md. A bare \\emph is ordinary emphasis: linking those made
    "countable" point at the sigma-algebra definition.
  * the \\index{...} entries themselves, which give the canonical, usually
    multi-word phrase ("compact operator", "compact space"). These disambiguate:
    the bare word "compact" is not linked, but each of its phrases links to its
    own definition.
  * a bare \\emph agreeing with the definition's own label leaf
    (def:b3:measure:measure <-> "measure space").
  * \\emph{term}\\index{...} outside a definition -- a theorem or an example often
    introduces a notion; the link targets that statement.

Theorem names ("Baire's theorem") are not terms: the point is to link
definitions, not results.
