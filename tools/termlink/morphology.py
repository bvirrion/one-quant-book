"""Turning a term into the regex that finds its uses.

English keeps exactly the rule Book 5 was generated with. French and Dutch need
two things English does not:

  * accents in two spellings. parts/grade-1..3/{fr,nl} write them as TeX escapes
    (unit\\'es, \\`a, \\c{c}); parts/grade-4..12/{fr,nl} write them as UTF-8
    (unités). Book 1 spans both, so a term harvested in grade-3 would never match
    in grade-6 unless the pattern accepts either spelling.
  * plurals on every word of a phrase (nombre pair -> nombres pairs), not just
    the last one, or most French phrase uses go unlinked.
